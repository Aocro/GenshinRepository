# GenshinRepository
This repository includes direct links to Genshin Impact updates. With this, it allows you to download Genshin Impact updates without a launcher, but using a download manager (like IDM, FDM, XDM, uGet, etc.).

Thank you for entrusting this repository to download Genshin Impact data directly. With a heavy heart, I have to stop this for personal reasons. But don't worry; I'm sure you can do it yourself. Once again, thank you for trusting this repository.

## Continue Maintaining For GenshinRepository

Because the previous repository has been archived by the owner and unmaintained, I will continue to maintain and provide updates on Genshin Impact data. Thanks so much to @RapDodge for providing this repository.
